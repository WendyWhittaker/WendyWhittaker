# Hey, I'm Wendy! 

## I'm a UX designer by trade, but someone interested im development since high school. 
I'm mainly here to follow some cool people I know on their development journey. 
You can see some of my work in the biz over here at <a href="http://www.wendywhittakerdesign.com"> Wendy Whittaker Design.</a> 
## Other socials 
I may be mildly cooler over on my LinkedIn, actually talking about the things I know.
