## I'm a UX designer by trade
I've been interested in development since high school and I'm mainly here to follow some cool people I know on their development journey. 
You can see some of my work in the biz over at <a href="http://www.wendywhittakerdesign.com"> Wendy Whittaker Design.</a> 
## Other socials 
I may be mildly cooler over on my LinkedIn, actually talking about the things I know.
